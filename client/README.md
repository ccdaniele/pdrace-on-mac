## About PodRace
![Alt text](image.png)

Function that displays the information about creators and maintainers of the page  PodRace is a FullStack application created by some Datadog's TSEs to connect and test Datadog features in a real and fun environment.

The logic behind this is to create a weekly "Tse Pods Race" in which the Players (TSEs) will collect points to their Pods (Specs) with Events.

These Events are day to day actions with points associated to them, example:

- Receive a flare = 5 pts
- Finishing a call = 10 pts
- Collaborate = 10 pts
- Run a workshop = 50 pts
- Bring cookies to the team = 1 billions pts (Yes, It's for you Jas)
